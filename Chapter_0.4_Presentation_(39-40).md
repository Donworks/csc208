## Functions

# What is a function?
- A function is a system where there is an input
- But depeding on that input there is an output
- Even though theres a different input and output there is a relation in the process

## Example

| Input | Relationship | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 0 | $x+3$ | 3 |
| 2 | $x+3$ | 5 |
| 4 | $x+3$ | 7 |
| 5 | $x+3$ | 8 |
| 7 | $x+3$ | 10 |

- In this example you can see that the input and output are different
- But the Relation is the same through out the process

## Vocabulary terms?
- When it comes to the Name of x and y values they have different Names
- Based on the fact that x and the input y is the output
 1. Domain is a set of x values which are the input to the function
 2. Codomain is a set of allowable ouutputs which means its a set of numbers that can be seen as a result
 3. Range which is the output of a set of natural numbers so {3,4,7,12,19,18}

 ## Example problems from Discrete Mathmatics book

- This represents what a function should look like these are just some of the examples that will be seen
