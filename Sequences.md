## Sequences 

# Describing Sequences
- When looking at a sequence it's a list of numbers that are in order but this is different
  from a N becasue this set of numbers is natural numbers. But in a seqence we care about
  the order which things go in so we use variables in the list like.

- But when refering to a sequnce all at one you could use the symbols <img width="125" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-22 at 8 39 46 AM" src="https://github.com/Donworks/csc208/assets/143621504/a7bb6f7f-9a5b-4664-bfa0-d50bfcfbd34c">
  or if you dont really care which you should just use <img width="34" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-22 at 8 42 25 AM" src="https://github.com/Donworks/csc208/assets/143621504/796c8a0b-0f94-41f6-9b12-6ec84de4673c">
  when doing this we must assume that (An) starts with (A0)

- When thinking of a Sequnce it's mostly thought of as a list of numbers.
  but really and truly its a function. when using variables we might not start with
   $({a_n})$ sometimes we would start with $({a_1})$ in a case like this we would use
  the formula $({a_n})_{n \ge 1}$ we use this when refereing to a whole sequnce

- We know that a sequence is truly a function especially when we look at
