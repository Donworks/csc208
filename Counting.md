## Additive and Multiplicative/

# what is Additive and Multiplicative

- Additive is when you have two events and and they dont relate in any form but your asked how many options do you have between the two for example there are 6 ice creams and 10 different hot dog items how many options do you have we would say 16

-                                        Event $A$ and Event $b$ | $a+b$ |

- Multiplicative is when two events can relate or they go togethere for example the shirt and pants represented in the book. 5 shirts and 9 pants in your wardrobe how many outfits can be made? well we would mutiply 5 shirts and 9 pants and that would give us the amont of outfits we have which would be 45.

  -                                        Event $A$ Event $B$  | $a*b$ |


## Counting with sets

- When counting with sets instead of thinking of A events as indivisual events it should be thought of as a set of different ways that event could happen same for event b 

- for example there are 10 supras with different body kits and 5 different types of turbos that can be applied them one set is |S| and |T| are both sets the questions are How many different supras can be made using each turbo on each model?

- for the additive principle | $SUT$ | = |S| + |T|

- Fot the Multiplicative principle | $SnT$ | = |s| * |t| in all the answer to the question would be | $10 * 5$ | $=$ | $50$ | this means there are 50 different supras 

- But lets say you had to multiply everything in a set? the multiplicative principal woudl be explained by the Cartesian Product when a set of A and B is A * B = { $(x,y): x element A and y = element B}

- For example |S| = (200, 320, 150) |T| = (5, 7, 4, 17, 19) so are result when multiplying the set
