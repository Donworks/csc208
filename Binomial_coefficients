## Binomial Coefficients

# Subsets 
- Before you continue on through the chapter i recommend that you go back to 0.3 which was sets to get a better of the termenoogy that will be used. 

- For example
 ![Alt text](https://file%252B.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/988990/Desktop/Screenshot%25202024-02-27%2520at%25206.25.59%2520AM.png?version%253D1709034115714)
 
 - Theres also set notation

 - so when we do a subset we are usually trying to see how many element pairs of elements are in a set aka $P(A)$. 

 - For example  is we have ${4, 2, 3}$

- Not done yet still in Progress!!!
